# Fractal Dimension and fractal Lacunarity Analysis

This repository provides a Python script developed as a **practical complement** to our article:  
**"Statistical Insights into Spatial Patterns: A Panorama About Lacunarity."**  

The script is designed to analyze and visualize **fractal dimension** and **fractal lacunarity** from open datasets.  
Its main goal is to identify the most relevant research areas and generate comparative charts between the two metrics.
